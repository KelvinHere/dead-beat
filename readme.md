# **Dead-beat**

## Features

- Collect parachute patches to the beat, get enough and survive
- Collecting patches earns points & increases score multiplier
- Missing patches resets your multiplier
- Beat pattern matches the song including lining up with certain instruments, multiple playthroughs are needed to learn the song (replay-value)
- Patches can appear as 1 beat, 1/2 beat, or 1/4beat
- Movement intially feels decoupled from the beat, but can be aligned to the music too, to get the FLOW STATE!
- Includes a variable BMP and the ability to split each beat into multiple notes for future songs
- Beats collected and score are decoupled, allowing an inexperienced player a chance at winning, and a pro player a focus on high score.
